# Task ID: 13
# Title: Mobile Demo Tests Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create demonstration mobile tests to showcase the framework's mobile testing capabilities with Appium integration.
# Details:
1. Implement mobile page objects for a sample mobile app:
   ```typescript
   export class MobileLoginScreen extends MobilePage {
     readonly usernameInput = this.driver.$('~username');
     readonly passwordInput = this.driver.$('~password');
     readonly loginButton = this.driver.$('~login');
     
     async login(username: string, password: string): Promise<MobileHomeScreen> { ... }
   }
   ```
2. Create test cases for common mobile interactions:
   - Touch gestures (tap, swipe, pinch)
   - Device orientation changes
   - App lifecycle (background, foreground)
   - Native dialogs and permissions
3. Implement tests for both Android and iOS platforms
4. Add tests for mobile web using Playwright's mobile emulation
5. Create utilities for handling mobile-specific challenges (keyboard, notifications, etc.)
6. Implement cross-platform test cases that work on both Android and iOS

# Test Strategy:
Run the mobile tests on Android and iOS emulators/simulators. Verify that mobile-specific interactions work correctly and that tests can run on both platforms with minimal platform-specific code.

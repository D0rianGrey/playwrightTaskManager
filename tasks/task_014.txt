# Task ID: 14
# Title: Performance Demo Tests Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create demonstration performance tests using k6 to showcase the framework's load testing capabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement k6 scripts for different load scenarios:
   ```typescript
   // load-test.ts
   import http from 'k6/http';
   import { check, sleep } from 'k6';
   
   export const options = {
     stages: [
       { duration: '30s', target: 20 },
       { duration: '1m', target: 20 },
       { duration: '30s', target: 0 },
     ],
   };
   
   export default function() {
     const res = http.get('https://test-api.example.com/contacts');
     check(res, {
       'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
       'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
     });
     sleep(1);
   }
   ```
2. Create test cases for:
   - Load testing (steady concurrent users)
   - Stress testing (increasing load until failure)
   - Spike testing (sudden increase in users)
   - Endurance testing (sustained load over time)
3. Implement performance thresholds and assertions
4. Add reporting and visualization of performance metrics
5. Create scenarios that simulate real user behavior
6. Implement data correlation between requests

# Test Strategy:
Run the performance tests against test endpoints with controlled environments. Verify that metrics are collected correctly and that different load patterns produce expected results. Test threshold validation for performance criteria.

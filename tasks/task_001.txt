# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and TypeScript Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with TypeScript, Playwright, and essential dependencies to establish the foundation for the testing framework.
# Details:
1. Create a new repository and initialize with npm/yarn
2. Install TypeScript and configure tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled
3. Install Playwright and Playwright Test as the main test runner
4. Setup ESLint and Prettier for code quality
5. Configure directory structure following best practices:
   - src/
     - core/ (base classes and interfaces)
     - ui/ (UI testing components)
     - api/ (API testing utilities)
     - mobile/ (mobile testing components)
     - performance/ (load testing integration)
     - utils/ (common utilities)
     - config/ (configuration management)
6. Create initial package.json with scripts for building, linting, and running tests
7. Setup .gitignore and other repository configuration files

Example tsconfig.json:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@core/*": ["src/core/*"],
      "@ui/*": ["src/ui/*"],
      "@api/*": ["src/api/*"],
      "@mobile/*": ["src/mobile/*"],
      "@performance/*": ["src/performance/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"],
      "@config/*": ["src/config/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify the project setup by running:
1. TypeScript compilation check (tsc --noEmit)
2. ESLint validation
3. Simple Playwright test to ensure the environment is correctly configured
4. Check that all dependencies are properly installed and accessible
